# FinalProject

Gather the required information on the Bay Area and usage of phones

Create a list containing the information and figure out how to cohesively make a project that can contain them all

Create the basic sketch of the first page project on Atom

The first page may contain a question about how much we rely on phones in the Bay Area

Get the certain pulls and references working before moving on (Why do errors keep happening? I don't know)

When things are beginning to work correctly, work on the other pages

The second page would be a timecount most likely, with a background of the cities relating to the count

The third page would probably be a clicking sort of game to see how one in a few do not use phones often or even do not have one

The fourth page is another count, most likely the usage of electronics in general

The fifth might be more of a message about how much we are using and how that is affecting

Sixth might be a thank you note or just a trivia fact, definitely up for debate.
