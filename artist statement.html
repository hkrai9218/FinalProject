<p id="statement">
This project is inspired by information regarding the advancements
in technology and the amount of time we spent on it.
There are various information and a little bit of a game like quiz
to make estimations based on percentages of people using smartphones
in both the Bay Area and the United States.
Throughout looking at the history there is this strange
disconnecting feeling knowing what life used to be like
before smartphones became a major part of society.
To incorporate that feeling, there are some unsettling moments in the
piece to convey a bit of a hinderance or annoyance.
Other instances includes a little quiz of sorts, similar to a science
game that you would play to complete a task in school.
